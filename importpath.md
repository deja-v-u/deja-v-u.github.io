An import path (see 'go help packages') denotes a package
stored in the local file system.  In general, an import path denotes
either a standard package (such as "unicode/utf8") or a package
found in one of the work spaces (see 'go help gopath').

Relative import paths

An import path beginning with ./ or ../ is called a relative path.
The toolchain supports relative import paths as a shortcut in two ways.

First, a relative path can be used as a shorthand on the command line.
If you are working in the directory containing the code imported as
"unicode" and want to run the tests for "unicode/utf8", you can type
"go test ./utf8" instead of needing to specify the full path.
Similarly, in the reverse situation, "go test .." will test "unicode" from
the "unicode/utf8" directory. Relative patterns are also allowed, like
"go test ./..." to test all subdirectories. See 'go help packages' for details
on the pattern syntax.

Second, if you are compiling a Go program not in a work space,
you can use a relative path in an import statement in that program
to refer to nearby code also not in a work space.
This makes it easy to experiment with small multipackage programs
outside of the usual work spaces, but such programs cannot be
installed with "go install" (there is no work space in which to install them),
so they are rebuilt from scratch each time they are built.
To avoid ambiguity, Go programs cannot use relative import paths
within a work space.

Remote import paths

Certain import paths also
describe how to obtain the source code for the package using
a revision control system.

A few common code hosting sites have special syntax:

	Bitbucket (Git, Mercurial)

		import "bitbucket.org/user/project"
		import "bitbucket.org/user/project/sub/directory"

	GitHub (Git)

		import "github.com/user/project"
		import "github.com/user/project/sub/directory"

	Google Code Project Hosting (Git, Mercurial, Subversion)

		import "code.google.com/p/project"
		import "code.google.com/p/project/sub/directory"

		import "code.google.com/p/project.subrepository"
		import "code.google.com/p/project.subrepository/sub/directory"

	Launchpad (Bazaar)

		import "launchpad.net/project"
		import "launchpad.net/project/series"
		import "launchpad.net/project/series/sub/directory"

		import "launchpad.net/~user/project/branch"
		import "launchpad.net/~user/project/branch/sub/directory"

	IBM DevOps Services (Git)

		import "hub.jazz.net/git/user/project"
		import "hub.jazz.net/git/user/project/sub/directory"

For code hosted on other servers, import paths may either be qualified
with the version control type, or the go tool can dynamically fetch
the import path over https/http and discover where the code resides
from a <meta> tag in the HTML.

To declare the code location, an import path of the form

	repository.vcs/path

specifies the given repository, with or without the .vcs suffix,
using the named version control system, and then the path inside
that repository.  The supported version control systems are:

	Bazaar      .bzr
	Git         .git
	Mercurial   .hg
	Subversion  .svn

For example,

	import "example.org/user/foo.hg"

denotes the root directory of the Mercurial repository at
example.org/user/foo or foo.hg, and

	import "example.org/repo.git/foo/bar"

denotes the foo/bar directory of the Git repository at
example.org/repo or repo.git.

When a version control system supports multiple protocols,
each is tried in turn when downloading.  For example, a Git
download tries git://, then https://, then http://.

If the import path is not a known code hosting site and also lacks a
version control qualifier, the go tool attempts to fetch the import
over https/http and looks for a <meta> tag in the document's HTML
<head>.

The meta tag has the form:

	<meta name="go-import" content="import-prefix vcs repo-root">

The import-prefix is the import path corresponding to the repository
root. It must be a prefix or an exact match of the package being
fetched with "go get". If it's not an exact match, another http
request is made at the prefix to verify the <meta> tags match.

The vcs is one of "git", "hg", "svn", etc,

The repo-root is the root of the version control system
containing a scheme and not containing a .vcs qualifier.

For example,

	import "example.org/pkg/foo"

will result in the following request(s):

	https://example.org/pkg/foo?go-get=1 (preferred)
	http://example.org/pkg/foo?go-get=1  (fallback)

If that page contains the meta tag

	<meta name="go-import" content="example.org git https://code.org/r/p/exproj">

the go tool will verify that https://example.org/?go-get=1 contains the
same meta tag and then git clone https://code.org/r/p/exproj into
GOPATH/src/example.org.

New downloaded packages are written to the first directory
listed in the GOPATH environment variable (see 'go help gopath').

The go command attempts to download the version of the
package appropriate for the Go release being used.
Run 'go help get' for more.

Import path checking

When the custom import path feature described above redirects to a
known code hosting site, each of the resulting packages has two possible
import paths, using the custom domain or the known hosting site.

A package statement is said to have an "import comment" if it is immediately
followed (before the next newline) by a comment of one of these two forms:

	package math // import "path"
	package math /* import "path" */

The go command will refuse to install a package with an import comment
unless it is being referred to by that import path. In this way, import comments
let package authors make sure the custom import path is used and not a
direct path to the underlying code hosting site.

See https://golang.org/s/go14customimport for details.
